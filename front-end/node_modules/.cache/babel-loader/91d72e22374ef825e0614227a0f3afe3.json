I didn’t have a lifelong desire to become an accountant although I always enjoyed numbers and found patterns in numbers with ease. My desire to understand the mechanics of business and become an accountant happened (painfully) as result of my father’s business going into bankruptcy at the beginning of the 1990’s as bank base rates in England rose to almost 15%, I am pleased to report he has long since been back on his feet and is doing well. Ever since then, I have set myself the personal challenge to safeguard the sustainability of any enterprise I have been involved with and to positively support high-quality decision making. They say good things come out of bad: this must be it. Ever since the mid-90s I have been fortunate to work with great leaders and learn so much and have been offered countless opportunities to support businesses that have exhausted their options and needed fresh thinking to support a resurgence in their performance and their people. Over the following 10 years, I was known by recruiters as the go-to person when things needed turning around and I am proud to say in the last 15 years every single organisation I served has shown significant improvement in their people and finances: most within 1 financial cycle. My approach is to lead through doing, in shirt sleeves rolled up approach and not being too important to help anyone with a worthwhile need. My experiences have included Director position in various well-known organisations and during these periods I have forged lasting relationships with the team members in Agile as well as many others I am proud to call my friends. Amongst the organisations I have in my history are Starbucks, GlaxoSmithKline, Schneider Electric, Westminster University, Sodexho, DEFRA, British Land, Samsung, Aventis Pharma, Ceridian & Future Cities Catapult.
